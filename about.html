              <i>Where?</i> is a young startup company based in St. John's, Newfoundland.
              The goal of our company is to bring convenience to renting event spaces, for events such as
              wedding receptions, conferences and anything else you can think of.
              <br><br>
              If you have space to rent, our databases will automatically
              suit customers to your rental space, based on their requirements. A direct message between the client
              and owner of the space will then be initiated to discuss the fine details.
            </p>
